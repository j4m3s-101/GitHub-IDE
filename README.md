**This is an IDE running on GitHub Actions which can help in.....**
1. Running small snippets.
2. Running codes whenever PC is not available and setting python on mobile is pain in ass.
3. Copy pasting in proper indentations which is harder while using Mobile to code.
4. Showing code executions to public/Sharing them online.
5. Have a greate collection of snippets for duture use.
6. Testing codes on different environments without owning them.  [`[Refer this]`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)

- Gets pip cache and install üîª dependencies. 
- Runs the input in the comment message. 
- Comments you back with code execution.
